title: Starting Out Bayesian
excerpt: Check out some new intro textbooks on applied Bayesian analysis
---

Bayesian analysis is certainly nothing new, but particularly in the 
social sciences I feel there is a bit of institutional inertia.
Slowly but surely people are moving away from thumbs-up/thumbs-down
hypothesis testing, magic "*p* &lt; 0.05" thresholds, and
point-and-click recipes.

I think a vital ingredient in obtaining greater acceptance of Bayesian
methods is the availability of introductory stats textbooks that
*start out* Bayesian, rather than leaving it to an appendix after
thoroughly confusing students with frequentism.
Software tools and hands-on simulation should be embedded in the
curriculum from the first week, and forget about asking students
to calculate sums-of-squares by hand!

Richard McElreath has recently completed a textbook aimed for
social science grad students (so don't worry, it is not dauntingly
technical!) which works up from linear regression to generalized
linear multilevel models (aka mixed-effect, including
repeated-measures).  And does it all from a Bayesian perspective,
including abundant examples in R to illustrate how to build your
own models.  Check it out!
